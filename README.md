# PlatformerGame
This was made as a project for a college course. It was written in lua and can be built using the Corona SDK. For anyone that might have stopped by this page, I am truly sorry for not bothering to separate the code/sounds/images into separate folders. Perhaps I will organize the files a bit at some point.
